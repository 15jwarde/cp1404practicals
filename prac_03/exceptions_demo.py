CP1404/CP5632 - Practical
Answer the following questions:
1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?

# 1. Will occur when the users input is a string or a number that is not and integer (int).
# 2. Occurs when the second user input is zero.
# 3. You could add a while loop after the 2nd input that error checks the input.
