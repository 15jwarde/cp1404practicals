# CP1404 Practicals

*By Jorja Warde*

Welcome to my CP1404 repository for practical work.

## Main Lessons

Throughout my coding journey, three main lessons I have learnt about clean code are:

- **Approach code one step at a time:**
    - I often find myself working on code out of order, especially when I hit a roadblock within my code. However, this
      often creates more problems down the line when the code I'm testing requires a fully complete, working code
      section that I either previously skipped or gave up on and left broken
- **Use Good Naming:**
    - I often receive feed back that my variables names are inconsistent. So continuing to work on my variable naming is
      important as good naming is essential to creating readable code.
- **"ctrl + alt + lovely"**
    - "ctrl + alt + l" is the quickest way to instantly improve the readability of your code. Anytime I see a squiggly
      green checkmark in the top right corner, I instantly use the shortcut to fix the formatting. If the check remains,
      I know that there is another issue I must address before moving on.
